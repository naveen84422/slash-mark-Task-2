# Home Price Prediction using XGBoost

## Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning, specifically **XGBoost**, to predict home prices based on various factors like **income levels, school proximity, hospitals, crime rates, and more**. The model helps in **real estate decision-making** by providing accurate price estimates.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing key trends in home prices.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Using **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Understanding the impact of different factors on home prices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning** (XGBoost, Scikit-Learn)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd home-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset includes various features affecting home prices.
- You can use publicly available datasets or collect real estate data.
- Make sure your dataset includes fields like **location, area, number of bedrooms, crime rate, nearby schools, etc.**

## Usage
1. **Preprocess Data**: Run the script to clean and prepare the dataset.
2. **Train Model**: Execute the training script to fit the XGBoost model.
3. **Evaluate Model**: Check performance metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score.
4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict house prices.

## Results
- The model achieves high accuracy in predicting home prices.
- Feature importance analysis provides insights into key price determinants.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more advanced models like **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)**.
- Enhancing feature selection with **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**.
- Deploying as a **web app** using Flask/Django.
